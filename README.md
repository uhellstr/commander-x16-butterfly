# Commander X16 Butterfly demo.

In October 2010 I was bored and desided to write a small graphical demo in C64 Basic.
I even did a Youtube video about this program and promised a assembler version of it.
The assemebler version I never got around to. Recently I have done some retro programming
again now mainly in CC65 and thought to myself that port my old Basic demo should be
easy. So I did one very straightforward implentation for C64 and this one is for the
Commander X16 emulator.

For instructios to setup CC65 google it or see the CC65 github repo.
Is is very easy to install and setup. For Commander x16 i recommend to
install thru github repo to make sure you get the support for the
Commander X16 emulator. (Homebrew on Mac include the support if you
are on Mac and prefer it.)

So here comes...
The original Butterfly Basic program 
Implemented in C for Commander X16 using the CC65 compiler.
It runs allot faster then the old Basic demo did.

Now about that assembly code I promised long ago...hmmm...

Compile to PRG with included Makefile

Example:

$ make

The Youtube video is still availible at:
