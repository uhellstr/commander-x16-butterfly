# Commander X16 Butterfly demo.

In October 2010 I was bored and desided to write a small graphical demo in C64 Basic.
I even did a Youtube video about this program and promised a assembler version of it.
The assemebler version I never got around to. Recently I have done some retro programming
again now mainly in CC65 and thought to myself that port my old Basic demo should be
easy. So I did one very straightforward implentation for C64 and this one is for the
Commander X16 emulator.

So here comes...
The original Butterfly Basic program 
Implemented in C for Commander X16 using the CC65 compiler.
It runs allot faster then the old Basic Demo did.

Now about that assembly code I promised long ago...hmmm...

Compile to PRG with included Makefile
Example:
$ make
